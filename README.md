Cloudlet Client

Cloudlets are discoverable, generic, stateless servers located in single-hop proximity of mobile devices, that can operate in disconnected mode and are virtual-machine (VM) based to promote flexibility, mobility, scalability, and elasticity. In our implementation of cloudlets, applications are statically partitioned into a very thin client that runs on the mobile device and a computation-intensive Server that runs inside a Service VM.
